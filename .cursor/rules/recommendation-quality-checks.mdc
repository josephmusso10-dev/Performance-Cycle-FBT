# Recommendation Quality Checks

When editing or reviewing `product_recommendations.csv`, validate every recommendation before finalizing changes.

- Recommendations must be complementary items, not the same product type.
- Example: pants should recommend jackets, gloves, or boots, not more pants.
- Avoid duplicate or near-duplicate recommendations for the same source product.
- If compatibility is required, only recommend accessories that fit the specific product model.
- Helmet-specific rule: face shields, visors, pinlock inserts, and other helmet accessories must explicitly match the helmet brand/model.
- If compatibility is uncertain, mark it for manual verification instead of keeping it as a valid recommendation.

Before completion, report any rows that fail these checks and propose corrected recommendations.
